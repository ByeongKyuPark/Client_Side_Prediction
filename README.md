# Overview

This repository contains a series of interconnected projects developed to enhance online gaming experiences. From establishing a robust user management system to implementing advanced client-side prediction algorithms, each project builds upon the last, cumulating in a secure, scalable application deployed on AWS EC2.

## Key Features

- **RESTful User Management**: Utilizes Express & Node.js for efficient user operations.
- **Database Integration**: Incorporates MongoDB for user data and Redis for session management.
- **Replication Testbed Enhancement**: Adds authentication and secure game connection setup.
- **Client-Side Prediction**: Improves gameplay under high latency.
- **Deployment on AWS EC2**: Ensures scalability and security with Nginx and PM2.

## Highlight: User Authentication
For a detailed example of the authentication process within the gaming platform, see the [`UserLoginState.cpp`](UserLoginState.cpp) file. This file demonstrates how user login and session management are handled, ensuring secure access to the game.
